Description: Non-blocking concurrency framework for PHP
 Amp is a non-blocking concurrency framework for PHP. It provides an event loop,
 promises and streams as a base for asynchronous programming.
 .
 Promises in combination with generators are used to build coroutines, which
 allow writing asynchronous code just like synchronous code, without any
 callbacks.
